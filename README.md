# About Link Tracker

In this project we are trying to create a chrome extension in which user can save there link or tab in the chrome browser for future work or to remember the site.
This project consist HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT files to execute the chrome extension.
To get the link of current active tab we ask the chrome API to provide the link as an input that later be displayed on the Tracker page.

Happy Coding!
